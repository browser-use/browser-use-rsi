# Failure Analysis - Browser Use RSI

## Run Data Analyzed
- Run ID: kh78t62wqxq9qv5fgjmns2bm5d7qqja7
- Branch: main (baseline)
- Total Tasks: 10
- Success Rate: 0%
- All tasks failed but 3 got perfect scores (1.0) for proper error handling

## Key Failure Patterns Identified

### 1. **Cloudflare/Bot Detection Challenges** (Critical Issue)
**Tasks Affected:** 4 out of 10 tasks (40%)
**Error Category:** "Incorrect Result" and "Give Up"
**Websites:** napaonline.com, autozone.com

**Root Cause:**
- Human verification challenges (Cloudflare CAPTCHA)
- Press & hold verification challenges
- No robust retry or bypass strategy

**Evidence:**
- "persistently blocked by a Cloudflare human verification page"
- "immediately blocked by a human verification (press & hold) challenge"
- Agent attempts basic clicking but fails to handle verification properly

**Impact:** High - blocks access to major automotive parts websites

### 2. **Insufficient Page Load Waiting/Verification** (High Priority)
**Tasks Affected:** 2 out of 10 tasks (20%)
**Error Category:** "Incorrect Result"
**Website:** lkqonline.com

**Root Cause:**
- Not waiting for "Loading..." indicators to disappear
- Not implementing page reload when loading takes too long
- Premature conclusion that content isn't available
- Insufficient use of dynamic content detection

**Evidence:**
- "failed to verify page load status (no check for 'Loading...')"
- "did not scroll or extract page data beyond the header/footer"
- "prematurely concluded with 'No part found' without deeper inspection"

**Impact:** Medium - results in false negatives for available products

### 3. **Site Maintenance/Connectivity Issues** (External Factor)
**Tasks Affected:** 4 out of 10 tasks (40%)
**Error Category:** Usually handled correctly (scored 1.0)
**Websites:** shop.advanceautoparts.com, oreillyauto.com

**Root Cause:** External - sites actually down
**Handling:** Actually handled well - proper error reporting
**Impact:** Low - external issue, good error handling

## Technical Analysis

### Browser Use Code Areas to Investigate:
1. **Anti-bot detection handling** - likely in navigation/browser management
2. **Page load verification** - waiting strategies and dynamic content detection
3. **Element detection robustness** - when content loads asynchronously
4. **Retry mechanisms** - for transient failures and loading issues

### Success Pattern:
- Tasks that properly detected and reported external errors (site offline) scored perfectly (1.0)
- This shows the evaluation framework rewards proper error handling

## Recommended Fix Priority:

### Priority 1: Enhanced Page Load Detection
- Implement robust waiting for "Loading..." indicators
- Add automatic page reload on prolonged loading
- Better dynamic content detection and waiting strategies

### Priority 2: Anti-Bot Detection Improvements
- Enhanced Cloudflare/CAPTCHA detection
- Stealth browsing techniques (user agent rotation, timing delays)
- Alternative navigation strategies when blocked

### Priority 3: Improved Element Detection
- More robust scrolling and content extraction
- Better handling of dynamically loaded elements
- Progressive timeout strategies

## Expected Impact:
- Fix Priority 1 issues: +20% success rate improvement
- Fix Priority 2 issues: +40% success rate improvement
- Combined: Potential 60% success rate improvement from current 0%
