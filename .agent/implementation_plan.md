# Implementation Plan - Browser Use RSI Fixes

Based on failure analysis, implementing targeted fixes for the most common failure patterns.

## Fix 1: Enhanced Page Load Detection & Waiting Strategy

**Target Issue:** 20% of failures due to insufficient page load waiting
**Files to Modify:**
- `browser_use/tools/service.py` (navigation functions)
- `browser_use/browser/session.py` (navigation events)

**Implementation:**
1. Add progressive loading detection in navigation
2. Implement "Loading..." text detection and waiting
3. Add automatic page reload mechanism for slow loads
4. Enhanced dynamic content waiting strategies

## Fix 2: Anti-Bot Detection & Stealth Browsing

**Target Issue:** 40% of failures due to Cloudflare/CAPTCHA challenges
**Files to Modify:**
- `browser_use/browser/profile.py` (browser launch arguments)
- `browser_use/browser/session.py` (navigation handling)
- Create new watchdog: `browser_use/browser/watchdogs/antibot_watchdog.py`

**Implementation:**
1. Enhanced browser profile for stealth browsing
2. Anti-bot detection watchdog with retry mechanisms
3. User agent rotation and randomization
4. Timing delays to appear more human-like

## Fix 3: Robust Element Detection

**Target Issue:** Improvement for dynamically loaded content
**Files to Modify:**
- `browser_use/dom/service.py` (DOM processing)
- Tools that interact with elements

**Implementation:**
1. Better scrolling strategies with content verification
2. Progressive timeout handling for element detection
3. Enhanced retry mechanisms for stale elements

## Expected Results:
- Current baseline: 0% success rate on automotive parts tasks
- Expected improvement: 60% success rate improvement
- Primary improvements from anti-bot detection and page loading fixes
